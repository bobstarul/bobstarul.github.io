#Lab03-02.dll

Now, for the analysis of the _Lab03-02.dll_ things are a little bit different. Windows doesn't know how to run _.dll's_ automatically, so we have to find a few commands in order to successfully launch it.  

The syntax which we wil use is:

rundll32.exe _DLLname_, _Export arguments_

The Export value has to be a function name or an ordinal from the exported function table in the _.dll_. We can use PEStudio to view the _Export_ table and, hopefully, find the value that we need. 

As we can see in the following screenshot, a few functions are found :
- Install
- ServiceMain
- UninstallService
- installA
- uninstallA

![1_PEStudio-Exports][1_PEStudio-Exports]

Install appears to be one that might render useful to us.

Now, let's take a look at the strings in this sample to get a feeling about what this malware can do.

![2_PEStudio-Strings][2_PEStudio-Strings]

We can find a command to run _cmd.exe_, that is _cmd.exe /c_, using the _/c_ flag in order to open a new shell, execute the provided command and exit the shell automatically.

There are also some Registry paths seen :
- _SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\_
- _SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost_

A network-based indicator can be seen : 
- _practicalmawlareanalysis.com_

The presence of the file _serve.html_ can be used as a host-based indicator.  

The functions imported are from the _kernel32.dll_, _advapi32.dll_, ws2_32.dll_, _wininet.dll_, _msvcrt.dll_ libraries.

The socket functions lead us to think that it might try to connect to another machine. Also, with the HTTP and Internet functions, it's clear that it will want to create different requests and open and read files from the internet. 
It will also read different files, execute some, start services and also use _sleep_  probably as a way to not make so much noise on the machine.

Now, let's get into some dynamic analysis.

First, let's start:
- Process Explorer
- Process Hacker
- Process Monitor and exclude all the process that are not of need for us right now.
- Regshot, and take the 1st shot.
- Wireshark on the other machine.
- ApateDNS, INetSim

 Once we are set up, let's run the samples using the following command:

> rundll32.exe Lab03-01.dll, Install

!!*NOTE*!! *Lab03-01.dll didnt't launch as expected. The process is suspended once it launches. Some indicators and information may be missing from this analysis. *

Let's first take a look at the following screenshots:

![44_Service_Installed][44_Service_Installed]

![5_ProcMon_554Events][5_ProcMon_554Events]

![6_1_RegShot][6_1_RegShot]

![6_2_Regshot_52Changes][6_2_Regshot_52Changes]

As we can see, a new service has been installed: _IRPIP (Intranet Network Awareness (INA+))_ . It's, of course, a fake one. 

With the use of _ProcMon_, we can see that 554 events have been created. Also, with _RegShot_ we can see that it stores different values in the _HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentrControlSet\Services\IPRIP\_ registry, such as : the path of the sample, a command for svchost, different hex addresses and more. In total, there have been 52 changes to the registry made.
