#Lab 7-1


Analyze the malware found in the file Lab07-01.exe.


Questions


1. How does this program ensure that it continues running (achieves persistence) when the computer is restarted?

This program ensures that it continues running by creating a service known as Malservice.

<p align="center"> Figure 1.1 </p>





2. Why does this program use a mutex?

This program uses a mutex to ensure that there aren't more instances of the same malware running.
The functions required to check for a mutex can be seen in Figure 2.1.

3. What is a good host-based signature to use for detecting this program?

Good host-based signatures are the mutex named _HGL345_ and the service _MalService_.





4. What is a good network-based signature for detecting this malware?

A good network-based signature for detecting this malware is the Browser-Agent _Internet Exporer 8.0_ that sends requests to _www.malwareanalysisbook. com_.




5. What is the purpose of this program?


The purpose of this program is to run a DDOS attack to the URL mentioned above.   
After checking if another instance of the program already runs and establishing itself as a service running at boot, it creates a wait timer until 1st of January 2100, as seen in Figure 5.1.

<p align="center"> Figure 5.1 </p>

Next, in Figure 5.2, we can see that it creates a thread 20 times. 

![Figure 5.2](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-1/Q5.2_Lab07-01.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 5.2 </p>

The lpStartAddress argument points to a loop that performs an unconditional jump, meaning that this loop will run forever, downloding the www.malwareanalysisbook.com URL. (Figure 5.3)

So, 20 threads will be downloading that page forever resulting in a DDOS attack.

6. When will this program finish executing?

This program will never finish executing. It waits until 1st of January, 2100 when it will create 20 threads that run in an infinite loop.




#Lab 7-3

> For this lab, we obtained the malicious executable, Lab07-03.exe, and DLL, Lab07-03.dll, prior to executing. This is important to note because the malware might change once it runs. Both files were found in the same directory on the victim machine. If you run the program, you should ensure that both files are in the same directory on the analysis machine. A visible IP string beginning with 127 (a loopback address) connects to the local machine. (In the real version of this malware, this address connects to a remote machine, but we’ve set it to connect to localhost to protect you.)
>
> __WARNING__ This lab may cause considerable damage to your computer and may be difficult to remove once installed. Do not run this file without a virtual machine with a snapshot taken prior to execution.
>
> This lab may be a bit more challenging than previous ones. You’ll need to use a combination of static and dynamic methods, and focus on the big picture in order to avoid getting bogged down by the details.

Questions


1. How does this program achieve persistence to ensure that it continues running when the computer is restarted?



2. What are two good host-based signatures for this malware?
One good host-based signature for this malware is the presence of a mutex named "SADFHUHF", as seen in Figure 2.1.

## Lab07-03.dll analysis

After creating the mutex, the sample uses socket-specific functions in order to establish a connection to "127.26.152.13".(Figure 5.1)

![Figure 5.1](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/socket_functions.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 5.1 </p>

Afterwards, it sends "hello" as a message back to the hacker to let him know that it has been successful so far and that it can send further commands. 

![Figure 5.2](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure5.2.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 5.2 </p>

Then, the malware receives commands through the same socket. The sample checks if the command is received is "sleep" or "exec". In case of the first one, it will sleep for 60s. Upon receiving "exec" as a command, the malware will then proceed to create a process. As of the .dll it is not clear what this process is. (Figure 5.3)

![Figure 5.3](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure5.3.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 5.3 </p>\

In the end, it will close the socket and shutdown the connection.

## Lab07-03.exe analysis

At the very beginning, we can see in Figure 6.1 that the program checks if there are two arguments upon calling it. If there are not 2 arguments at the moment of executing the program, it will just terminate itself. 

![Figure 6.1](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure6.1.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 6.1 </p>\

Next, in figure 6.2, there is a loop that is checking if the argument specified is "WARNING_THIS_WILL_DESTROY_YOUR_MACHINE"

![Figure 6.2](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure6.2.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 6.2 </p>\

Up until now, we know that if the program is not run with the above mentioned argument, it will just exit.

Upon correctly executing, it will run _Kernel32.dll_ to open _Lab07-03.dll_, as seen in Figure 6.3.

![Figure 6.3](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure6.3.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 6.3 </p>\

Then, there are a lot of mathematical operations performed and a few functions called that we can look into in Figure 6.4 and Figure 6.5. I've named them _boring_maths_ as they are not of any importance right now. (haha)

In the end, in Figure6.6, things start to become a lot more interesting. We can see that the program stopped writing into the files, as it closed the handles. Then, it copies our malicious dll, _Lab07-03.dll_ into _C:\\Windows\\System32\*kerne132*.dll_ in an attempt to make it look like the legit file, kernel32. This is also called masquerading, a devense evasion tactic, documented in the MITRE Framework. (Check it out if you haven't already!! https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)

![Figure 6.6](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure6.6.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 6.6 </p>\


Next, we see that the string "C:\\" is pushed onto the stack before calling the _sub_4011E0_ function. Let's look into that now!

The first function called is _FindFirstFileA_ with the above found argument. Then, a bunch of other math operations are being made.

![Figure 6.7](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure6.7.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 6.7 </p>\

Subsequently, we find a call to _stricmp_. A string is being compared with _.exe_ (Figure 6.8). We then find _sub_4010A0_. 

![Figure 6.8](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure6.8.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 6.8 </p>\

Now, what we find interesting in here is the _stricmp_ function between _kernel32.dll_ and another string. 
The _repne scasb_ correspons to the strlen function and the _rep movsd_ to the memcpy function. 

![Figure 6.9](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure6.9.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 6.9 </p>\

Looking into the offset _dword_403010_ we find that it's hex value starts with 3. *Hex values beginning with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 are ASCII characters*. By Pressing A on the keyboard with our cursor on the  _dword_403010_ value, IDA will convert the data into the string kerne132.dll. 

![Figure 6.10](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure6.10.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 6.10 </p>\



Finally, we understand that it will replace the _kernel32.dll_ string with _kerne132.dll_ with the fake dll that was placed in C:\Windows\System32\.

Going back to our function, we encounter a call to our _sub_4011E0_ function, meaning that the studied function is a recursive one. 

![Figure 6.11](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_7/Lab7-3/Figure6.11.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 6.11 </p>\


We can now, finally, make an assumption regarding the behaviour of this malware.

The malware will look for all the executables (_.exe_) in systems that have _kernel32.dll_ in their memory and replace it with _kerne132.dll_.
It does this so that any executable that runs on the system access _kerne132.dll_ instead of _kernel32.dll_.
