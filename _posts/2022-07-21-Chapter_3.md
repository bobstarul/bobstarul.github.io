Hello!  
Welcome to the walkthrough of Chapter 3 - Labs.

# Chapter 3

## Lab 3-1

> Analyze the malware found in the file Lab03-01.exe using basic dynamic analysis
tools.  

> 1.What are this malware’s imports and strings?

![Q1_Strings_Lab03-01.exe][Q1_Strings_Lab03-01.exe]

Using _strings_ we found the following : 
- An URL:
  - _www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com_
- Registry keys:
  - _SOFTWARE\Classes\http\shell\open\commandV_
  - _SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders_
  - _SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run_
  - _Software\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\_
- A CONNET HTTP Method:
  - _CONNECT %s:%i HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n_
- An executable file name:
  -  _vmx32to64.exe_
- Other strings: 
  - AppData
  - StubPath
  - advapi32
  - advpack
  - ntdll


As far as imports go, we can only find the function _ExitProcess_ from the _kernel32.dll_ library.

![Q1_Imports_Lab03-01.exe][Q1_Imports_Lab03-01.exe]

> 2.What are the malware’s host-based indicators?

Host-based indicators of this malware are the presence of the _vmx32to64.exe_ file and modified registry keys.


> 3.Are there any useful network-based signatures for this malware? If so,
what are they?

Yes, the network-based signature for this malware is the connection to the _www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com_ URL .
