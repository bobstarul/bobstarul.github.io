Alright!! Let's get familiar with C code constructs in Assembly. 

# Lab 06-01

> In this lab, you will analyze the malware found in the file Lab06-01.exe.
>
> Questions
>
> 1. What is the major code construct found in the only subroutine called by main?

The main function can be seen in Figure 1.1.

![Q1_Lab06-01.exe](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_6/Lab6-1/Q1_Lab06-01.exe.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 1.1 </p>

Now, let's look into the subroutine, in Figure 1.2.

![Q1.1_Lab06-01.exe](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_6/Lab6-1/Q1.1_Lab06-01.exe.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 1.2 </p>


We can see that there is a call being made to the function _InternetGetConnectedState_. The program checks for an internet connection. 

At 0x401015 a conditional jump is made. If the condition is met, a string will most likely print on the screen, saying that there is no internet connection. On the other side, another message stating that there is a connection will pop up on the screen.

The major code construct found in the only subroutine called by main is an **if statement**. 



> 2. What is the subroutine located at 0x40105F?

The block of code can be seen in Figure 2.1.

![Q2_Lab06-01.exe](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_6/Lab6-1/Q2_Lab06-01.exe.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 2.1 </p>


Taking into consideration that the subroutine is called in the if statement right after a string being pushed to the stack, **we can assume that the subroutine located at 0x40105f is a printf statement**.



> 3. What is the purpose of this program?

The purpose of this program is to check for an internet conection. If it exists, a message will be printed on screen regarding the result.


# Lab06-02

> Analyze the malware found in the file Lab06-02.exe.
>
> Questions
> 1. What operation does the first subroutine called by main perform?

The first subroutine called by main is the one analyzed before. It performs an if statement to check if an internet connection exists.


> 2. What is the subroutine located at 0x40117F?

The subroutine located at 0x40117F is the **printf function**. We can now rename it.

![Q2.1_Lab06-02.exe](/assets/img/PMA/Chapter_6/Lab6-2/Q2.1_Lab06-02.exe.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 2.1 </p>


> 3. What does the second subroutine called by main do?

The second subroutine opens an internet connection and tries to download the page at _http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/cc.htm_ .


> 4. What type of code construct is used in this subroutine?

In this subroutine, the if statement is used. Also, checking the microsoft documentation regarding the _InternetReadFile_ function, we can assume that the buffer variable is an array.


> 5. Are there any network-based indicators for this program?

Yes, the network-based indicator for this program is the URL _http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/cc.htm_


> 6. What is the purpose of this malware?

It firstly checks for an internet connection. Then, using the subroutine _401040_, it opens an internet connection in order to read a file from the practicalmalwareanalysis URL. Then, it tries to read a string from the html file, character by character. If it finds the string "<!- -"(without the space in between the dashes) then, the program will print a "success:parsed command is X ", string. 

After this, the value 60.000 is pushed on to the stack before the _Sleep_ function to make the program sleep for 60s.

> 2. What parameters does this new function take?





> 3. What major code construct does this function contain?





> 4. What can this function do?





> 5. Are there any host-based indicators for this malware?
